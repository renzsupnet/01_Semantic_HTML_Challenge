# Refactoring Code Into Semantic Elements

## Description
    A challenge to add accessibility features to improve search engine optimization as well as to improve code readability. To improve the code's readability, 
    rather than use an abundance of <div> containers we use semantic elements like <aside>, <main>, <header>, <footer>, etc. The purpose of this is to give a 
    clue or a correlation with that section of code with its intended purpose or location. Doing so, it makes the code cleaner and more organized, making it
    easier to read and troubleshoot should the need arise.

## What was done:
- turned div elements into semantic elements such as header, footer, etc.
- added alt description for images to improve accessibility and improve seo
- updated css to reflect semantic elements changes
- added display:flex to accomodate change in screen size
- added comments to give context clues and improve code readability
- consolidated similar css properties into a singular css line
